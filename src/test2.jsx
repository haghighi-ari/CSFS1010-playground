            <h1>Construction</h1>
            <p>
                Construction is a members-only skill that allows players to build their own houses and provide furniture for them. To begin Construction, players must buy a house from one of the estate agents. A starter house will cost 1,000, and will be in Rimmington. A level 40 Magic spell can then be used to teleport to the house, or a house tablet be used. Alternatively players can walk to Rimmington, where there is a portal (House portal icon.png icon on the map) that will teleport players to their house.

                The house starts off with only a parlour and garden, but furniture and additional rooms can be built. To build, go to the options menu, select house options, and set the building mode mode to on. Players will then see what looks like ghost-like hotspots where new objects can be built. See the Constructed items list for details on what you can build at what level.

                Players can visit a friend's house if they are online and using the same portal. Players can also use the offical house party worlds to make use of max level houses, without having to build one themselves. The house advertisement next to the portal showcases said houses.

            <h2>How to start training construction</h2>
            <p>Buying a house</p>
            <p>The first step in training the construction skill is buying a player-owned house. A house costs 1,000 coins and can be bought by talking to an estate agent. Alternatively players can complete the miniquest Daddy's Home earning a house as a reward.</p>

            <h6>Estate agent</h6>
            <p>
                Estate agents are NPCs that sell players land to build their house on. These agents can be found in several major cities: Varrock, Falador, Seers' Village, East Ardougne, and Hosidius. They are identified on the minimap by a symbol of a small house (Estate Agent icon.png). Players must pay 1,000 coins to purchase their first house in Rimmington, and begin training the Construction skill.

                After reaching certain level milestones between level 1 and 70, players can pay an estate agent to move or decorate their house. For more information on this subject, visit the estate agent page.

                Estate agents also sell the Construction cape for 99,000 coins to anyone with level 99 Construction.
            </p>

            <h2>Materials</h2>
            <p>
                There are multiple materials needed for constructing your house. Most furniture options contain one or more of these items that are often used in the Construction skill. When used in a piece of furniture, these items will reward the player with a set amount of Construction experience. (i.e. When constructing an object with oak planks, this will always reward the player with 60 experience per plank.)

            <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

            <h4>Servants</h4>
            <p>
                Servants can be hired at the Servants' Guild, the very north-eastern building in Ardougne. There are five different servants, which can perform various services. All servants are able to greet guests entering a players' home, but some will have different abilities, such as taking items to and from the bank or sawmill. The higher level servant a player has, the faster their service is, the better food they provide, and the more items they can carry to or from a bank or sawmill.

                After using a servant's services seven times, the servant will ask the player to pay them. After using a servant's services eight times, the player is required to pay them or the servant will quit. A player can build a Servant's moneybag and put coins in it to automatically pay their servant.

                A player must have at least two bedrooms with beds in them in order to hire a servant. A player may only have one servant at a time; if a player wants to hire a new servant, they must fire their current one first.

            <h5>Phials for unnoting</h5>
            <p>
                Phials is an NPC located next to the Rimmington General Store in Rimmington who will un-note items for 5 coins per item.

                Phials is commonly used by players training Construction due to his proximity to the Rimmington house portal. He is also useful for training Prayer on a gilded altar in a player-owned house.
            </p>

            <h1>Training methods</h1>

            <p>Popular training methods include continuously constructing and removing the following items:</p>

            <p>Mahogany Homes is an alternative method of training that tasks players with constructing furniture for various NPCs across Gielinor.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

            <h3>Cape of accomplishment</h3>

            <p>
                A Construction cape is the Cape of Accomplishment for the Construction skill. It can be purchased for 99,000 coins alongside the Construct. hood from any Estate agent by players who have achieved skill mastery (level 99) in the Construction skill.

                When the Construction cape is equipped or in the inventory, it provides unlimited teleports to the player's own house and to the house portals located in Rimmington, Taverley, Pollnivneach, Hosidius, Rellekka, Brimhaven, Yanille, and Prifddinas.
            </p>

            <h2>STASH units</h2>
            <p>
                STASH units (short for "Store Things And Stuff Here"), also known as hidey holes, are storage units for emote clue items, saving bank space and bank trips for players who do Treasure Trails frequently.

                There are 103 STASH units in total found throughout Gielinor. These locations are initially labelled as inconspicuous bushes/crates/holes/rocks, and, once built, become usable STASH units. Players can check which units they've already built/filled by visiting Watson and reading the noticeboard within his house, or reading the chart in their PoH study after it's been built.

                The materials and level required to build these inconspicuous objects into STASH units depend on the tier of clue scroll they relate to. A hammer and a saw are required to build STASH units. All 10 nails must be made of the same metal.

            <h2>Chambers of Xeric</h2>
            <p>The storage units in the Chambers of Xeric are created using the Construction skill, thus having a Construction level requirement: small storage unit (Construction 30 ), medium storage unit (Construction 60 ), large storage unit (Construction 90 ), and Massive storage unit (Construction 99 ).</p>
